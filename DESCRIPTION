Description: It is rare that structural equation models (SEMs) are able to reject the null
    hypothesis that there is no misspecification in the model. One explanation for this problem
    is that covariance structures are influenced by major factors which we can hypothesize about
    and minor factors which we cannot predict a-priori. This package lets you fit regular and
    meta-analytic Bayesian SEMs that estimate the influence of minor factors.
