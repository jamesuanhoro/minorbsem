Description: Structural equation models (SEMs) rarely reject the null hypothesis
    that there is no model misspecification. One explanation for this problem
    is that covariance structures are influenced by major factors, which we can
    hypothesise about and minor factors, which we cannot predict a priori.
    These minor factors are random; precisely, they are measurement-instance
    specific.
