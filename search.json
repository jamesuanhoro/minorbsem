One may also interpret metric standard deviation SRCs 95% SRCs lying within 2 RMSE values 0. example, RMSE = 0.063 can expect SRCs greater 0.10, suggesting large SRCs (Maydeu-Olivares 2017). Large SRCs challenge notion model misspecification due influence minor factors – influences large, factors “minor”? possible hypothesized structure incorrect, minor factors significant effects.","code":""},{"path":"https://jamesuanhoro.github.io/minorbsem/articles/cfa.html","id":"substantive-parameters","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Basic CFA Model > Fit the model","what":"Substantive parameters","title":"Confirmatory Factor Analysis","text":"parameter estimates reported type parameter: factor loadings, inter-factor correlations, error variances. model, items load respective factors intervals clearly exclude 0. factors assumed standardized minorbsem, correlations reported; factors non-trivially correlated.","code":""},{"path":"https://jamesuanhoro.github.io/minorbsem/articles/cfa.html","id":"residual-plots","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Basic CFA Model","what":"Residual plots","title":"Confirmatory Factor Analysis","text":"Given RMSE suggests large standardized residual covariances (SRCs), can request plot SRCs using two options: range-plot heat-map.   heat-map particularly useful highlighting largest SRCs.
