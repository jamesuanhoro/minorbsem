  abstract   = {Markov chain Monte Carlo is a key computational tool in Bayesian statistics, but it can be challenging to monitor the convergence of an iterative stochastic algorithm. In this paper we show that the convergence diagnostic Rˆ of Gelman and Rubin (1992) has serious flaws. Traditional Rˆ will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a new approach to factor analysis and structural equation modeling using Bayesian analysis. The new approach replaces parameter specifications of exact zeros with approximate zeros based on informative, small-variance priors. It is argued that this produces an analysis that better reflects substantive theories. The proposed Bayesian approach is particularly beneficial in applications where parameters tu-e added to a conventional model such that a nonidentified model is obtained if maximum-likelihood estimation is applied. This approach is useful for measurement aspects of latent variable modeling, such as with confirmatory factor analysis, and the measurement part of structural equation modeling. Two application areas are studied, cross-loadings and residual correlations in confirmatory factor analysis. An example using a full structural equation model is also presented, showing an efficient way to find model misspecification. The approach encompasses 3 elements: model testing using posterior predictive checking, model estimation, and model modification. Monte Carlo simulations and real data are analyzed using Mplus. The real-data analyses use data from Holzinger and Swineford's (1939) classic mental abilities study, Big Five personality factor data from a British survey, and science achievement data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988.},

Over the years, many software pack-ages for structural equation modeling have been developed, both free and commercial. However, perhaps the best state-of-the-art software packages in this field are still closed-source and/or commercial. The R package lavaan has been developed to provide applied researchers, teachers, and statisticians, a free, fully open-source, but commercial-quality package for latent variable modeling. This paper explains the aims behind the develop-ment of the package, gives an overview of its most important features, and provides some examples to illustrate how lavaan works in practice.},

  abstract = {When a statistically significant mean difference is found, the magnitude of the difference is judged qualitatively using an effect size such as Cohen's d. In contrast, in a structural equation model (SEM), the result of the statistical test of model fit is often disregarded if significant, and inferences are drawn using " close " models retained based on point estimates of sample statistics (goodness-of-fit indices). However, when a SEM cannot be retained using a test of exact fit, all substantive inferences drawn from it are suspect. It is therefore important to determine the size of the model misfit. Standardized residual covariances and residual correlations provide standardized effect sizes of the misfit of SEM models. They can be summarized using the Standardized Root Mean Squared Residual (SRMSR) and the Correlation Root Mean Squared Residual (CRMSR) which can be used as overall effect sizes of the misfit. Statistical theory is provided that allows the construction of confidence intervals and tests of close fit based on the SRMSR and CRMSR. It is hoped that the use of standardized effect sizes of misfit will help reconcile current practices in SEM and elsewhere in statistics. Goodness-of-fit assessment refers to how well our model reproduces the data-generating process. When fitting a regression model, researchers assess the goodness-of-fit of their model by inspecting a plot of the standardized residuals versus standardized fitted values in order to check the linearity and homoscedasticity assumption of the model. Failure to meet the model assumptions will likely result in incorrect parameter estimates. Simply put, when the fitted model is incorrectly specified, all inferences based on it are suspect. In structural equation modeling (SEM), we fit a system of regression-like equations to our data (possibly involving latent variables), and procedures similar to those used in regression can be used to assess each of the equations in the model (Bollen \& Arminger, 1991; Coffman \& Millsap, 2006; Hildreth, 2013; Yuan \& Hayashi, 2010). However, they hardly seem to be used in applications. Rather, for historical reasons, the assessment of model fit in structural equation models has relied on the use of grouped data (residual means, covariances, and correlations) as opposed to individual residual observations. There is evidence that residual covariances (i.e., the differences between observed and fitted covariances) are sensitive to linear mis-specifications (Raykov, 2000) but I am not aware of any research that has examined whether they are sensitive to the presence of heteroscedasticity. Residual summary statistics such as residual covariances can be summarized into a single test statistic to assess the overall goodness-of-fit of a struc-tural equations model. Although overall test statistics are invariably reported in applications, they are most often ignored as they usually suggest that the model is incorrectly specified. Rather, Presidential Address to the Psychometric Society, delivered at the annual meeting in Madison (WI), July 2014. Rosseel for their helpful comments. I am also most thankful to Yves Rosseel for implementing these methods in the Lavaan package in R.},
