  abstract = {Accounting for model misspecification in Bayesian structural equation models is an active area of research. We present a uniquely Bayesian approach to misspecification that models the degree of misspecification as a parameter â€“ a parameter akin to the correlation root mean squared residual. The misspecification parameter can be interpreted on its own terms as a measure of absolute model fit, and allows for comparing different models fit to the same data. By estimating the degree of misspecification simultaneously with structural parameters, the uncertainty about structural parameters reflect the degree of model misspecification. This results in a model that produces more reliable inference than extant Bayesian SEMs. Additionally, the approach estimates the residual covariance matrix which can be the basis for diagnosing misspecifications and updating a hypothesized model. These features are confirmed using simulation studies. Demonstrations with a variety of real world examples show additional properties of the approach.},

  abstract = {We present a fully Bayesian approach to meta-analytic SEM based on hierarchical modeling of sample covariance matrices. The approach allows for flexible models that would not be identified under a traditional maximum likelihood approach. The approach allows for the inclusion of moderators, produces a global fit index, and permits the investigation of local misspecification. Simulation-based calibration studies show that the Bayesian computation procedure produces valid inferences for commonplace meta-analytic SEM applications. We demonstrate the approach with diverse data analysis examples and provide accompanying R code to support adoption and additional study of the approach. Finally, we lay out proposals that have the potential to extend the approach to accommodate the wide variety of analyses and data conditions that comprise meta-analytic SEM applications.},

  abstract   = {In the traditional presentation of the common-factor model, measured variables are represented as exact linear combinations of common and unique factors. From the perspective that no mathematical model will fit real-world phenomena perfectly, it is suggested that this representation is problematic. It is not consistent with the phenomena it is intended to model, and it does not provide an adequate basis for understanding some issues inherent in factor analysis. An alternative representation of the model that incorporates a "lack-of-fit" term into the initial equation for the measured variables is proposed. Subsequent derivation of the covariance form of the model in the population and the sample yields a framework that allows for differentiation of various sources of error that arise in applications of the model. These developments provide a basis for study of some important issues such as model definition, parameter estimation, and sample size. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {We present an approach to quantifying errors in covariance structures in which adventitious error, identified as the process underlying the discrepancy between the population and the structured model, is explicitly modeled as a random effect with a distribution, and the dispersion parameter of this distribution to be estimated gives a measure of misspecification. Analytical properties of the resultant procedure are investigated and the measure of misspecification is found to be related to the root mean square error of approximation. An algorithm is developed for numerical implementation of the procedure. The consistency and asymptotic sampling distributions of the estimators are established under a new asymptotic paradigm and an assumption weaker than the standard Pitman drift assumption. Simulations validate the asymptotic sampling distributions and demonstrate the importance of accounting for the variations in the parameter estimates due to adventitious error. Two examples are also given as illustrations.},

                To systematically evaluate the latent structure of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) through reanalysis of previous studies and meta confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
                Method
                Data from 28 samples were obtained from published studies concerning the latent structure of the HADS. Ten models were considered, including eight previously identified models and two bifactor models. The fit of each model was assessed separately in each sample and by meta CFA. Meta CFA was conducted using all samples and using subgroups consisting of community samples, cardiovascular disease samples and samples from studies administering the English language version of the HADS.
                Results
                A bifactor model including all items loading onto a general distress factor and two orthogonal anxiety and depression group factors provided the best fit for the majority of samples. Meta CFA provided further support for the bifactor model with two group factors. This was the case using all samples, as well as all subgroup analyses. The general distress factor explained 73\% of the covariance between items, with the (autonomic) anxiety and (anhedonic) depression factors explaining 11\% and 16\%, respectively.
                Conclusion
                A bifactor structure provides the most acceptable empirical explanation for the HADS correlation structure. Due to the presence of a strong general factor, the HADS does not provide good separation between symptoms of anxiety and depression. We recommend it is best used as a measure of general distress.},

  abstract      = {This article proposes a new approach to factor analysis and structural equation modeling using Bayesian analysis. The new approach replaces parameter specifications of exact zeros with approximate zeros based on informative, small-variance priors. It is argued that this produces an analysis that better reflects substantive theories. The proposed Bayesian approach is particularly beneficial in applications where parameters tu-e added to a conventional model such that a nonidentified model is obtained if maximum-likelihood estimation is applied. This approach is useful for measurement aspects of latent variable modeling, such as with confirmatory factor analysis, and the measurement part of structural equation modeling. Two application areas are studied, cross-loadings and residual correlations in confirmatory factor analysis. An example using a full structural equation model is also presented, showing an efficient way to find model misspecification. The approach encompasses 3 elements: model testing using posterior predictive checking, model estimation, and model modification. Monte Carlo simulations and real data are analyzed using Mplus. The real-data analyses use data from Holzinger and Swineford's (1939) classic mental abilities study, Big Five personality factor data from a British survey, and science achievement data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988.},
