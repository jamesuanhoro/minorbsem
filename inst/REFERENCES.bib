  abstract   = {In the traditional presentation of the common-factor model, measured variables are represented as exact linear combinations of common and unique factors. From the perspective that no mathematical model will fit real-world phenomena perfectly, it is suggested that this representation is problematic. It is not consistent with the phenomena it is intended to model, and it does not provide an adequate basis for understanding some issues inherent in factor analysis. An alternative representation of the model that incorporates a "lack-of-fit" term into the initial equation for the measured variables is proposed. Subsequent derivation of the covariance form of the model in the population and the sample yields a framework that allows for differentiation of various sources of error that arise in applications of the model. These developments provide a basis for study of some important issues such as model definition, parameter estimation, and sample size. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {We present an approach to quantifying errors in covariance structures in which adventitious error, identified as the process underlying the discrepancy between the population and the structured model, is explicitly modeled as a random effect with a distribution, and the dispersion parameter of this distribution to be estimated gives a measure of misspecification. Analytical properties of the resultant procedure are investigated and the measure of misspecification is found to be related to the root mean square error of approximation. An algorithm is developed for numerical implementation of the procedure. The consistency and asymptotic sampling distributions of the estimators are established under a new asymptotic paradigm and an assumption weaker than the standard Pitman drift assumption. Simulations validate the asymptotic sampling distributions and demonstrate the importance of accounting for the variations in the parameter estimates due to adventitious error. Two examples are also given as illustrations.},

  abstract = {We propose a generalized double Pareto prior for Bayesian shrinkage estimation and inferences in linear models. The prior can be obtained via a scale mixture of Laplace or normal distributions, forming a bridge between the Laplace and Normal-Jeffreys’ priors. While it has a spike at zero like the Laplace density, it also has a Student’s t-like tail behavior. Bayesian computation is straightforward via a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm. We investigate the properties of the maximum a posteriori estimator, as sparse estimation plays an important role in many problems, reveal connections with some well-established regularization procedures, and show some asymptotic results. The performance of the prior is tested through simulations and an application.},
